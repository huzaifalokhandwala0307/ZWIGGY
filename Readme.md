✅ This README will make your **GitHub project look professional**.

If you want, I can also give you a **better GitHub project title + description + tags** so your repo looks even stronger.

This project is open source and available under the **MIT License**.

whats this

That line in the README:

“This project is open source and available under the MIT License.”

means people are allowed to use your project code under certain rules.

📜 What an MIT License Means

The MIT License is a very simple open-source license.

If you publish your project with it, others can:

✅ Use your code
✅ Modify your code
✅ Share your code
✅ Use it in their own projects (even commercial ones)

But they must:

Keep your copyright notice

Mention the MIT license

Example

Someone could take your Zwiggy project, improve it, and build a bigger app from it — but they must still mention you as the original author.

Do you actually need it?

For college / portfolio projects, it's optional.

You have 3 choices:

1️⃣ MIT License (most common for GitHub projects)
2️⃣ No license – people technically cannot reuse your code
3️⃣ Private repo – only you see it

If you want to use MIT License

Create a file called:

LICENSE

Then add:
